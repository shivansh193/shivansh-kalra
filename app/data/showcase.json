            "inspiration": "Working across multiple startups and projects exposed me to a recurring pattern: infrastructure in production-grade systems was often bloated, inefficient, and expensive. The rise of generative AI and rapid, phased development cycles accelerated this problem—teams were shipping code faster but wasting compute resources due to poor architectural decisions made early on. I realized that most infrastructure issues could be caught before deployment if we had deterministic analysis at the design and build phases. Invariant was born from the need to shift observability left and prevent costly mistakes before they reach production.",

            "implementation": "Invariant's core challenge was building a static analysis engine capable of understanding complex codebases deterministically. The system uses TypeScript/Rust-based AST parsers to trace data flow, detect anti-patterns like N+1 queries and missing indexes, and map infrastructure dependencies—all without executing the code. To make this actionable, I integrated the analysis into developer workflows via CLI, CI/CD pipelines (with PR commenting), and a web dashboard. The architecture graph visualization uses SVG rendering with interactive nodes representing services, databases, and APIs, dynamically generated from code analysis. The cost forecasting engine cross-references detected patterns with cloud pricing APIs to project monthly spend, enabling teams to optimize before deployment.",
